# popularTwitchApp
using Angular.js, I pull twitch's top games and those games' top streamers
I'm not sure whether or not I should call this an app.
It's a webpage that uses twitch.tv's api

It should work with chrome and firefox i think. Internet Explorer messes up the way it looks for now.

If you clone it all you have to do is open the html to see it
